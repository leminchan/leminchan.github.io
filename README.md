Hello! Welcome to the Github repository for my personal website. I made this using Create React App as a fun project to learn ReactJS.

It's still definitely a work in progress, though - feel free to leave comments and suggestions!

### Resources used:
1. ReactJS [https://reactjs.org/]
2. React's various libraries! React-bootstrap, Material-UI, and styled-components to name a few.
3. Learning responsive web design through flexbox [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background]
